### Greetings Class of 2020

We know how difficult it is for all of you. Just don't let the negativity and the pandemic eat you up.
We know it has been 4 years of constant efforts which made you what you are today. But when the time came to cherish the final moment it was gone. We cannot assure you a physical convocation this time, but hang on we have got something more interesting and fun for you.

### Motive:

As we all know, amongst this pandemic the students are not able to be physically present inside the campus.
Being one of the most important moments in one's student life, convocation is a memorable event for everyone.
In these situations, when students do not have the chance to bid farewell to the institute and their friends and spend some quality time for one last time,
IIT Guwahati has made sure students relive this event as if they were in the campus itself.


### Team Virtual Convocation:

Seeing all this, it was very important to create some platform which would be fun for the students, so that they don't feel bad about missing the convocation and at the same time it can be used as a platform to interact with the friends and faculties for one last time in their favourite spots of the institute.

Thus, came the idea of the **virtual presence experience**. This virtual presence was created by a team of faculty and students **(Team Virtual Convocation)**.

The virtual presence platform is created by a team led by **[Dr. M.K. Bhuyan, Professor, Department of EEE, IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/mkb/)**.The team also consists of his two students **[Snehil Sanyal](https://github.com/snehilsanyal)** and **[H Pallab Jyoti Dutta]()**, who are research scholars of **EEE Department, IIT Guwahati**.


## Instructions:
### About the Virtual Presence Space:

The virtual presence space uses **Gather Town** software along with some supporting softwares. The overall map for IIT Guwahati was made and imported to create the space.
The map consists of:
1. A view of different buildings like :
-	**Auditorium** (The Institute Anthem and keynote speech by  Director Sir)
-	**Conference Hall** (Videos of different fests and events)
-	**Admin Building**	(About the Institute)
-	**Library** (About CET and Library)
-	**Medal Holders Speech** (Near the lake)
-	**11 Department and 5 Academic Centres** (Department videos and sites)
2. Each block has a video of the department as well as a poster which directs to the department link.
3. Interactive environment with objects in each buildings.
4. A terrain which resembles that of IIT Guwahati, lake and trees.
 
The portal is very close to a Zoom meeting, but has a main difference that our portal allows students to have a **game like experience** of the environment with different objects, videos of different departments, speeches and much more.
